    "The first challenge is to define all your arguments correctly.\n",
    "Onerous as this is, perhaps 30% of the program is in accepting the arguments correctly!\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Be sure to use `choices` for the `seqtype` argument\n",
    "* Consider using `type=argparse.FileType('wt')` for the `--outfile`. You don't have to do this, but, if you do, then `args.outfile` will be an open, writable file handle!\n",
    "* You should also manually verify that `pctgc` is between 0 and 1 which can be done with a compound comparison like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "args = parser.parse_args()\n",
    "\n",
    "if not 0 < args.pctgc < 1:\n",
    "    parser.error(f'--pctgc \"{args.pctgc}\" must be between 0 and 1')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be sure to set the random seed immediately after accepting the arguments, _before_ you do anything using the `random` module.\n",
    "Then your program will need to get a \"pool\" of bases for creating the sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    args = get_args()\n",
    "    random.seed(args.seed)\n",
    "    pool = create_pool(args.pctgc, args.maxlen, args.seqtype)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the following `create_pool` function.\n",
    "The function accepts three positional arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    ". `pctgc`: The average percentage of GC content for each sequence\n",
